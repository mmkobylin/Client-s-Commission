                    <p>
                        My work is inspired by pareidolia; the phenomenon of perceiving patterns and imagery in objects and other visual stimuli. It formed the underlying grounding of Hermann Rorschach's famous psychological inkblot tests (themselves designed to measure reactions and the dynamics of descriptions rather than simply being defined by what is seen). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each painting consists of a carefully applied layer of acrylic paints that are left to mix and dry, before further layers are applied. The process usually takes two weeks before the final outcome is achieved. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of the works is to be evocative, imaginative, calming, and inspiring. There is no definitive reading of a painting, only imagery designed to stimulate the imagination of the viewer.
